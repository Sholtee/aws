Dear Uncle Bob,

I am writing to you to discuss the matter of my salary. I have been working diligently and contributing significantly to the company's success. Given my increased responsibilities and exceptional performance, I believe that a salary raise would be justified. I kindly request your consideration in revising my compensation to reflect my hard work and dedication.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
John Doe
